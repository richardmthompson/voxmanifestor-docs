# About Vox Manifestor

## What is Vox Manifestor?
Vox Manifestor is a unique voice-driven manifestation assistant that helps you bring your desires into reality. 
Through natural conversation with an AI "genie", you can articulate, refine, and manifest your wishes.

## Philosophy
The approach combines traditional "manifestation" techniques with modern voice technology and AI.
By speaking your wishes aloud, clarifying the details of present and desired states, and generally exploring and enhancing
your cognitive representations, you create a stronger connection to your goals and a clearer path to achieving them.

Having studied Cognitive Science and worked in Business Consulting and Coaching of various types, I was interested to 
use the power of Large Language Models to help people self-coach towards their goals.

## Core Concepts

### The Five Wishes
Your journey begins with defining up to five wishes. This focused approach helps maintain clarity and direction.

### Present & Desired States
For each wish, we help you map:
- Your current reality (Present State)
- Your target outcome (Desired State)
This clarity helps bridge the gap between where you are and where you want to be.

### Voice Interaction
Speaking your wishes and working with them verbally creates a more powerful and personal connection than typing.

I want to build the "genie" into a rational and logical coach who can guide you through the process naturally and intuitively.

## Experimental Prototype

Vox Manifestor App is currently an experimental prototype.
If people are interested in having access to a conversational genie / coach that helps with their high level goals,
I will continue developing the app.

It is very rudimentary at the moment and barely functional in many ways.

I see it developing into a seamless voice interaction between genie and user, with the genie modifying the visual interface
in response to the conversation that is being held.

Please provide feedback about what features you like, what you'd like to see improved, and what else you'd like to see in the future in the Vox Manifestor App!

## Why Voice-Driven Manifestation?
- Speaking aloud engages more of your senses
- Natural conversation flow helps uncover deeper insights
- Voice interaction creates stronger emotional connections
- Verbal affirmations amplify manifestation power

## Our Vision
We believe that the next generation of applications will be redefined by their voice-based intelligent interfaces.

The best applications will be those that can effectively understand and communicate, and help us by extending our existing cognition:

* our intelligence, planning and reasoning,
* our ability to execute the most effective goal-driven behaviours at the right time.
