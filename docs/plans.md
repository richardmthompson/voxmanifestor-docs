# Future Features!!

These are the big next steps I'd like to take with the app, if I can establish a user base interested in them:

## Brainstorming option for wishes

Sometimes it's difficult to think of what you want.  I'd like to just be able to list of a whole bunch of things that I might want to achieve, and then refine the list down to however many I want to keep.  Then manage the integration of these newly brainstormed wishes into the existing wish schema.

## Milestones

After brainstorming present and desired state, it's natural to consider what steps would take us from here to there.

## 'ELABORATE' mode in Concept Screen.

I like the idea of being able to just brainstorm a whole bunch of things that are related to one of a concept's present or desired state items.
I'm thinking a simple screen, with continuous listening, and our genie grabs each item and adds it to a list.
The user can then edit the list, deleting and re-ordering as needed.

## Use 'brain' on the main screen.

At the moment, only the concept screen uses the LLM brain as a conversational interface.
To keep it simpler and more precise, the main screen only uses direct commands, with no Ai other than voice recog.

## Saving and loading wish schemas

It would be great to be able to save your current wishes, wipe the slate and start again, then re-load a previous wish schema.

## Multiple levels of hierarchy

Ultimately, our goal structures are hierarchical in nature.  A goal may be accomplished via a sequence of sub-goals.
It would be good to be able to seamlessly navigate goal hierarchies via voice interaction with our 'genie', to help gain clarity at multiple levels of resolution.
